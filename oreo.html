      <h3 class="peta">Package Design</h3>
      <p>The overall packaging for this design is based on creating a way to keep the cookies freshness while doing so in a more ecofriendly way. For this reason a paper tube that can be sealed to keep the freshness of the cookies, as well as be recycled or repurposed, was used. Next, a bed formation template that allows you to slide the cookies out by placing your finger into the hole and pull out the bed is proposed. Finally, working with the limited amount of space for the information and design a sleeve overlay is added to the tube to showcase the texture of the cookies (as they do in their packaging). It was imperative that the proposed packaging be current yet at the same time stay within in the original look and feel of the Oreo brand.</p>
