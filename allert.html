      <p itemprop="description">Allergies are a common ailment and it can be hard thing to deal with. It can damage your immune system or cost you your life if you don’t get the help you need in a timely manner. Depending on your allergy, always having to check for the allergen can be time consuming, awkward, annoying, and something that young kids might not know how to do. They often avoid eating out and trying new foods, or feel unsafe when they do so. People with food allergies need an easier way to detect possible allergy triggers in their foods because people don’t/can’t always check what they eat. To fix this problem Allert is an allergy detector that provides an easy solution for people with food allergies to check that their food is safe to eat. It is a wearable device that has a chip where you physically place the chip in the food and within second the application will notify you if the food is safe to eat or not based on your set allergens.</p>
