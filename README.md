## About

When I was a little kid I could never sit still. I was always active and getting into trouble. I always liked the outdoors and was into a lot of sports as kid. I enjoyed art but it was never my main focus. Instead of drawing and playing with paint when I was growing up I was into a lot of things trying to figure out what I enjoyed.  It wasn’t till later in life when i got more into the art and the one thing I did start to enjoy first was acrylic painting because I always I liked how you can paint over your mistakes. Ever since then i have found my love for art and following my passion for it. I love expressing myself creatively in many forms and medias. I love illustration, logo and icon design, and creating clever but practical packing. It fascinates me how choosing the right - or the wrong - typography can make a project intriguing or totally illegible.
