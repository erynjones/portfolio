      <p>The main concept for the quote book is designed based on Winnie the Pooh, with each spread themed with a character combined with a quote they said. With each quote there is a word that represents the emotion the quote emits. The colour theme for each spread matches the colours of the specific character to create a cohesive representation of Winnie the Pooh. On each page, there is a drawing of a character along with a hand-illustrated initial capital of the character that says the quote. In order keep with the overall theme and maintain a consistent flow with the Winnie the Pooh, the book is die cut in the shape of a honey pot.</p>
